i do not fucking know how these works. Anyway. Yes, I do not mind c+h.

You can find me in the marts , near JJk Area. Well, I can be seen sittin w/ someone usually. Not my friend.

I'm always AFK playing Genshin Impact. But as i said, W2i. I may reply late, because my pony town is on my phone while Genshin Impact is on my Laptop. I like to check Pony town after some times so it doesn't get disconnected or kicked for being inactive.



if you see me just say "I hope you get Neuvillette‚Äù
