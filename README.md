i do not fucking know how these works. Anyway.

You can find me in the marts , near JJk Area. Well, I can be seen clinging to someone usually. Not my friend.

I'm always AFK playing Genshin Impact. But as i said, W2i. I may reply late, because my pony town is on my phone while Genshin Impact is on my Laptop. I like to check Pony town after some times so it doesn't get disconnected or kicked for being inactive.

Please, like I plead of you. I'M NOT RACIST. And I have been given a pass. Legally. But usually I say it for joke, but ehhh. The other race just laugh with me about it. It's still a sin, i believe. Is it? 

if you see me just say "I hope you get Neuvillette‚Äù
